Guidelines For Contributing Code
================================

If you're ready to contribute back some code/docs, the
process should look like:

* Fork the project on GitHub into your own account.
* Clone your copy of Tastypie.
* Make a new branch in git & commit your changes there.
* Push your new branch up to GitHub.
* Ensure there isn't already an issue or pull request out there on it.
  If you feel you have a better fix, please take note of the issue
  number & mention it in your pull request.
* Create a new pull request (based on your branch).
